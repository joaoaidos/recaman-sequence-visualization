# Recam치n's Sequence Visualization

This project provides a dynamic visualization o Recam치n's sequence,
implemented in C using the raylib library. The program automatically zooms out
to display the expanding sequence, offering a captivating look at this
mathematical phenomenon.

## Features

- **Automatic Zoom Out**: The visualization smoothly zooms out to accommodate the growing sequence.
- **C Implementation**: Efficient and fast rendering of Recam치n's sequence using C.
- **Raylib Integration**: Utilizes the raylib library for straightforward and powerful graphics rendering.
- **User-Friendly Display**: Clear and engaging graphical representation of the sequence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- GCC or any other C compiler

### Building the Program

Clone the repository and run the build script to compile the program. The
raylib library is included, so no additional setup is required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joaoaidos/recaman-sequence-visualization.git
cd recaman-sequence-visualization 
./build.sh
```

## Running the Program

After building, run the executable to start the visualization:

```bash
./main
```

## How It Works

The program calculates Recam치n's sequence and renders each step graphically
using raylib, automatically adjusting the zoom to fit the expanding pattern on
the screen.
